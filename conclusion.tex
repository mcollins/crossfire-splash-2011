\section{Conclusion}
Our work thus far has demonstrated that it is possible to incrementally refactor
and rearchitect an existing codebase while maintaining the ability to support
Firebug's large user-base with releases which are compatible with new releases
of Firefox. In addition we have shown it is possible to implement a system for
remote debugging similar to existing solutions in other browsers, but using a
modular approach that is written purely in JavaScript. The project has been
successful in attracting new contributors and new opportunities for Firebug,
enabling the project to explore new directions. Continuing this work will
provide numerous benefits for Firebug users as well new features that are in
demand, while allowing Firebug to adapt to possible future changes in Firefox,
and increasing the features offered by Firebug/Firebug Lite in other Web
browsers.

Crossfire is an on-going open source project with source\cite{crossfire-src}
and documentation\cite{crossfire-doc} made available as part of the Firebug
project, as is Firebug's source\cite{firebug-src} and developer
documentation\cite{firebug-doc}. Documentation and downloads for Firebug are
also available from the Firebug project's website.\cite{getfirebug}
