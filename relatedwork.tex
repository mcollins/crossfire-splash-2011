\subsection{Remote Protocols}
Many protocols have already been designed for the purposes of remotely debugging
an application running in another process, virtual machine, host, etc. The GNU
GDB debugger has an associated Remote Serial Protocol (RSP)\cite{gdb-rsp}. While
it is the only debugger we know of with its own song \cite{gdb-song}, it is
primarily designed for debugging code running on embedded systems, and would not be
well-suited for use with Firebug.
\subsubsection{JNDI/JDWP}
Java does remote debugging too.
\subsubsection{DBGp}
DBGp\cite{dbgp}, is an acronym for Debug Protocol, and was developed for version
2 of the XDebug debugger for the PHP language. Although it was designed not to
be language specific, many of the commands are intended to be synchronous, as
opposed to the asynchronous nature of Crossfire. DBGp also allows for the
debugger engine to send an event to a client via the 'notification' element,
with a custom body. However in order to support Firebug, we would need to define
the same events defined by Crossfire as DBGp notifications.
\subsubsection{Opera Scope Protocol}
The Opera browser has a built-in Web development tool called DragonFly,
which also supports the Scope remote debug protocol. The Scope protocol supports
XML and JSON formats, and features such as JavaScript debugging and remote DOM
inspection.
