\begin{abstract}
We present \textit{Crossfire}, a system and protocol designed to enable
debugging of Web pages in another process or machine. Issues specific to any one
Web browser are abstracted by the protocol and implementation,
allowing a new generation of Open Web development tools to be implemented. We discuss the major refactoring of Firebug, the open source Web debugging tool
to use \textit{Crossfire} and the interplay between goals and resources that such an effort requires.
In addition to the cross-browser focus of the protocol, we also discuss support for extensions which themselves will be
cross-browser and client-server.
