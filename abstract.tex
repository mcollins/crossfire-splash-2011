\begin{abstract}
We present Crossfire, a protocol designed to enable remote debugging with the
Firebug Web debugging tool, and an implementation of this tool as a Firefox
extension. We also present an architecture in which the user interface of
Firebug is separated from the back-end debugger into separate processes
connected via the Crossfire protocol.
